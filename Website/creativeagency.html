                How to set up your design
            </h2>
            <p class="color-gray align-left">Rack mount LCD monitors can save you a lot of space and help you form a convenient and efficient desktop for your 
                work or home study. The rack mount is set up so that the keyboard and LCD monitor are on a sliding rack that 
                lest you move them out from your desk or over it. Once you decide to invest in the rack mount LCD monitor, 
                you will have to install the rack and the monitor. Here, then, are steps in installing rack mount LCD monitors.
            </p>
            <p class="color-gray align-left">The first step in installing rack mount LCD monitors is to get out and get one. They are available at most any 
                home office or electronics store. Since the rack mounts are becoming more popular, they are easier to find now 
                then aver before. Once you have your set, bring it home and spread all of the parts out along with the instructions 
                so you can find what you need.
            </p>
            <p class="color-gray align-left">The first step will be to install the slides on your desk. Some rack mounting sets will include slides that are 
                “handed.” That means that each slide is assigned a side of the monitor rack, but there are also sets where either 
                slide can go on either side. Consult the instructions with your set to make sure you have mounted them correctly.

                Here, I focus on a range of items and features that we use in life without giving them a second thought such as Coca Cola, 
                body muscles and holding ones own breath. Though, most of these notes are not fundamentally necessary, 
                they are such that you can use them for a good laugh, at a drinks party or for picking up women or men.
